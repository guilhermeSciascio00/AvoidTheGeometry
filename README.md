<p> Avoid the geometry is a 2D top down game, where your main goal is to dodge the enemies as long as you can.</p>
<p> You can download the game in the AvoidTheGeometryGame folder</p>
<p> You can also play it in the browser <a href="https://gszy.itch.io/avoid-the-geometry"> Avoid The Geometry By GsZY</a></p>
<h2> Controls </h2>
<p> To move around is really simple, just move your mouse 🖱️ and the player will follow it</p>
<h2> How to Play </h2>
<p> You've three lives which are displayed in the player square, when you colide with an enemy you'll lose a life</p>
<p> You can also pause the game by pressing p</p>
<h2> Know Issues</h2>
<p> The game has a slight glitch, that if you play it in full-screen, you will see where the enemy spawns</p>
<p> I won't fix that on this project, so I can see my progression as I develop other games in Godot</p>
